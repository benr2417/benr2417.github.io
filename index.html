                                    Alright guys, let’s talk about a push day – one of my absolute favorite days in the gym. Now, when we’re talking about push day, we’re focusing on hitting those major muscle groups that help you press and push massive amounts of weight. That means we’re working the chest, shoulders, and triceps. This is the kind of day that builds power, strength, and size – everything you need to be dominant whether you're on the strongman stage or just trying to push your limits in the gym.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Warm-Up:<br><br>
                                    Before we get into the heavy lifting, we’ve got to make sure the body is warmed up and ready to go. I like to spend a good amount of time warming up my shoulders and elbows because we’re going to be pushing a lot of weight. Resistance bands, light presses, shoulder rotations – get the blood flowing. This is key, especially when you’re moving serious weight like I am. Injury prevention is priority number one.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Main Lifts: <br><br>
                                    Bench Press First up is the king of all push exercises: the bench press. We’re talking heavy weight here, folks. I like to work my way up with a couple of lighter sets, then hit some heavy triples or singles. The goal is to push as much weight as possible while keeping control. The chest, shoulders, and triceps all come into play here, so it’s a full upper-body blast. Technique is crucial – controlled lowering of the bar and an explosive push to engage maximum power.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Overhead Press Now, if you know anything about strongman, you know how important overhead pressing is. We move on to the overhead press – whether it’s with a barbell, dumbbells, or even a log press, this is a movement I live by. It’s going to target the shoulders primarily, but you’ll feel it in your triceps too. I’ll typically aim for heavy sets in the 5-8 rep range here. Make sure your core is tight, and don’t forget to use your legs for a little extra drive if you’re going for some big numbers.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Accessory Work<br><br>
                                    Once we’ve hammered those big lifts, it’s time to move on to accessory work to build up the smaller muscles and reinforce that pushing strength.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Incline Dumbbell Press I love throwing in the incline dumbbell press to target the upper chest a bit more. Dumbbells give you a great range of motion and help ensure both sides are equally strong. I’ll go moderate to heavy here, shooting for 8-12 reps. The key is to control the weights on the way down, then explode up.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Dumbbell Lateral Raises For the shoulders, I’ll add in lateral raises to really isolate the delts. It’s a bit of a finisher to round out the shoulder work, usually higher rep ranges, like 12-15 reps. Keep the movement controlled, and focus on feeling the muscles work.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Tricep Pushdowns Now, no push day is complete without hitting the triceps directly. Tricep pushdowns are a staple for me, whether I’m using a rope or straight bar. I’ll go for 3-4 sets of 12-15 reps here, really focusing on locking out that extension to squeeze the triceps.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Close-Grip Bench Press If I want to really push my triceps to their limit, I might add in a close-grip bench press. This hits the triceps hard while still giving the chest and shoulders a little more work. It’s a great way to finish up the day with a compound movement.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Finisher<br><br>
                                    To wrap up the session, sometimes I’ll throw in a high-rep push-up burnout or a few sets of dips. By this point, the chest, shoulders, and triceps should be on fire, but this just ensures they’ve got nothing left in the tank.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Final Thoughts<br><br>
                                    Push day is all about building raw power and size. You’ve got to focus on proper form and moving as much weight as possible with controlled, explosive movements. Consistency, heavy lifting, and hitting these exercises hard are what’s going to take your strength to the next level. Whether you’re a strongman or just chasing personal bests, push day is where you lay the foundation for serious upper-body strength. Now, go out there, put in the work, and get better every day!</p>

                                Alright guys, today we're diving into a pull day, specifically with a focus on hypertrophy. If you're looking to build muscle size and improve the overall density and thickness of your back, biceps, and rear delts, this is the day where we’re really going to dial in on those pulling movements. Remember, hypertrophy training is all about controlling the weight, focusing on the mind-muscle connection, and ensuring that we're creating enough volume and tension to maximize muscle growth.
                                <br><br>
                                Warm-Up<br><br>
                                Before we get into the heavy lifting, I always emphasize warming up properly. We want to get some blood into the muscles we’re going to train and improve mobility. I'll usually start with some band pull-aparts and face pulls to wake up the rear delts and upper back, which are key for maintaining shoulder health. You can also throw in a couple of light sets of lat pulldowns or rows just to get everything moving.
                                <br><br>
                                Main Lifts <br><br>
                                Deadlift (or Rack Pull) First off, we’ll start with a deadlift or rack pull, depending on what your goal is. For hypertrophy, I prefer focusing more on controlled reps with a moderate-to-heavy load, typically in the 6-8 rep range. The deadlift is going to hit the entire posterior chain – the lower back, glutes, hamstrings, traps, and, of course, the upper and mid-back. Make sure you're pulling with control, engaging the lats, and keeping tension on the back muscles throughout the movement.
                                <br><br>
                                Pull-Ups (Weighted or Bodyweight) Next, we’re moving into pull-ups, which I consider an essential movement for back hypertrophy. If you’re strong enough, add some weight with a dip belt or weighted vest. We’re aiming for 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps here, with full control, making sure to engage the lats and focus on the stretch at the bottom. If you can’t do pull-ups, you can swap in lat pulldowns for the same muscle activation.
                                <br><br>
                                Key Hypertrophy Movements<br><br>
                                Barbell or Dumbbell Rows Now, for thickness in the mid-back, I love incorporating barbell rows or dumbbell rows. When focusing on hypertrophy, I like to slightly lower the weight to get more control and use a fuller range of motion, aiming for 8-12 reps per set. Keep the elbows tucked close to your body to really target the lats and mid-back. The key here is not to just yank the weight – control the eccentric (the lowering phase) to maximize muscle tension.
                                <br><br>
                                Single-Arm Dumbbell Rows After bilateral rows, I like to add in single-arm dumbbell rows for more unilateral work. You’ll really be able to isolate the lats and get a full stretch at the bottom of each rep. I’ll usually aim for 10-12 reps per arm, ensuring that I’m squeezing the lat hard at the top and controlling the weight on the way down.
                                <br><br>
                                Chest-Supported T-Bar Rows For some upper back volume, chest-supported T-bar rows or machine rows are excellent choices. The chest support takes the lower back out of the equation and allows you to focus purely on squeezing the lats, traps, and rhomboids. Here, we’ll go for a higher rep range – 10-15 reps – and really focus on driving the elbows back and controlling the weight.
                                <br><br>
                                Accessory Work (Rear Delts and Biceps)<br><br>
                                Face Pulls Now let’s shift focus to the rear delts. I can’t stress enough how important rear delt work is for both aesthetics and shoulder health. Face pulls are one of my go-to exercises. I'll perform 3-4 sets of 12-15 reps, focusing on pulling the rope to eye level and squeezing the rear delts and traps.

                                Dumbbell Rear Delt Flyes Another favorite for rear delts is dumbbell rear delt flyes, where we can focus on the eccentric and use lighter weights to really control the movement. For hypertrophy, I like to go for higher reps, around 15-20 reps, to really pump up the delts and traps.
                                <br><br>
                                Barbell or EZ-Bar Curls Moving onto biceps, this is where we want to focus on controlled contraction and stretch. I love starting with barbell curls or EZ-bar curls to hit the biceps hard. We’re aiming for 8-10 reps here, using a full range of motion. Keep the elbows tucked in and control both the lift and the lowering phase for maximum hypertrophy.

                                Incline Dumbbell Curls One of the best bicep exercises to get that full stretch is the incline dumbbell curl. This exercise really emphasizes the long head of the bicep and allows for a great range of motion. Here, I’d aim for 10-12 reps per set, making sure to feel that deep stretch at the bottom of each rep and fully contracting at the top.

                                Hammer Curls Finally, to hit the brachialis and add thickness to the arms, I like to finish with hammer curls. This will help build that dense, full look to the biceps. For hypertrophy, go for 12-15 reps here, controlling the weight on the way down to maximize tension.
                                <br><br>
                                Finisher <br><br>
                                To finish the workout, I like to throw in a high-rep burnout set, like banded lat pulldowns or light cable rows, where I’m focusing purely on feeling the muscle work and driving as much blood as possible into the back and biceps. This can be something in the 15-20 rep range, really focused on pumping the muscles.
                                <br><br>
                                Final Thoughts<br><br>
                                When training for hypertrophy, the key is volume, control, and mind-muscle connection. We’re not just trying to lift the heaviest weight possible here; instead, we want to feel every rep and really focus on engaging the target muscles. It’s about creating tension, controlling the eccentric, and using full ranges of motion. Incorporate a mix of compound movements and isolation work, and don’t neglect the accessory muscles like rear delts and biceps – they’ll add balance and size to your physique. So, focus on form, push the volume, and let’s build some serious muscle on those pull days!

                                    <p>Alright guys, let me take you through leg day, Tom Platz style. Now, when it comes to building your legs, we're not talking about just working out – we’re talking about forging them into pillars of strength, endurance, and power. You have to embrace the pain, the burn, and the mental fortitude that comes with truly mastering leg day. It's not just about going to the gym and doing a few squats – it's about pushing yourself past what you thought was possible.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Warm-Up<br><br>
                                        Before you even think about touching that squat rack, you’ve got to get your legs ready. I like to warm up with leg extensions, but not just a light set – I’m talking about controlled, focused movements. You should be feeling every fiber of your quads contracting. Start light, but ramp up the weight and do 15-20 reps per set. This gets the blood flowing, loosens up the knees, and wakes up the muscles. It’s about priming the legs for the punishment they’re about to endure.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Squats – The King of All Exercises<br><br>
                                        Now, listen to me carefully: the squat is the foundation of leg development. You cannot build legs without squatting. Period. And I’m not talking about half-repping it. Full range of motion is the only way to truly engage the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. Get deep. That’s where the magic happens.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Start with a weight you can handle for 10-12 reps, and slowly build up. The squat is about finding that sweet spot where you’re working with enough weight to challenge you, but not so heavy that you can’t hit the depth. My goal here is to push to absolute failure. I’ll go for 5 sets of 10-15 reps, but each set is a fight. If you’re not struggling, you’re not doing it right. Squats should make you question whether you’ve got another rep in you. And when you think you’re done, that’s when you dig deep and go for one more.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Hack Squats – Isolation and Pain <br><br>
                                        After barbell squats, we move into hack squats. This exercise puts pure focus on the quads and allows for more isolation. But again, you’ve got to get deep into the movement. I like to load it up and go for 4-5 sets of 12-15 reps. I’m chasing the burn here – that burning sensation that tells you the muscle is fatiguing. When the lactic acid is building up, that’s when you know you’re growing. Don’t shy away from the pain – embrace it. Push through it.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Leg Press – High Volume<br><br>
                                        Now, let’s get into the leg press. A lot of people go too light or too heavy on the leg press, but for me, it’s all about volume. We’re here to completely exhaust the legs. I’ll load up a moderate weight and go for 4-6 sets of 20 reps. That’s right, 20 reps per set. And the key here is control. You’ve got to lower the weight slowly, feel the stretch, and then drive through your heels to push it up. No bouncing, no rushing. Every rep is deliberate. By the time you’re done, your quads should feel like they’re going to explode.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Lunges – Precision and Focus<br><br>
                                        Next up are walking lunges or stationary lunges, depending on what I’m feeling. Lunges are crucial for leg development because they hit the quads, hamstrings, and glutes in a different way. I like to go for 3-4 sets of 12-15 reps per leg, focusing on depth and balance. Control is everything here. Step forward, drop into the lunge, and drive up through your front leg. It’s not about speed – it’s about maintaining tension throughout the entire movement.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Leg Curls – Hamstring Focus<br><br>
                                        We can’t forget the hamstrings. Moving on to lying leg curls or seated leg curls, we’re targeting the back of the legs. The key here is to feel every inch of the movement – stretch the hamstrings at the bottom and contract hard at the top. I like to go for 4 sets of 12-15 reps, keeping the focus on constant tension. Hamstrings respond well to high rep, controlled sets, so don’t rush through these.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Stiff-Legged Deadlifts – Stretch and Squeeze<br><br>
                                        To really bring out the hamstring detail, I’ll throw in stiff-legged deadlifts. This exercise stretches the hamstrings and glutes while working the lower back. The goal here is to stretch as far as possible while keeping a slight bend in the knees. I’ll aim for 3-4 sets of 10-12 reps, really focusing on the stretch at the bottom and the squeeze at the top.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Calf Work – No Shortcuts<br><br>
                                        We’re not done yet. You can’t have massive quads and weak calves – that’s unacceptable. I hit calves with as much intensity as everything else. Standing calf raises or seated calf raises, I’m aiming for 5 sets of 15-20 reps. Calves need high volume and full range of motion. Stretch at the bottom, explode to the top, and squeeze as hard as you can. It’s about forcing blood into the muscle and creating that hypertrophy effect.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Final Thoughts<br><br>
                                        Leg day is not for the faint of heart. It’s about mental toughness as much as physical strength. You’ve got to embrace the pain, embrace the burn, and keep going even when your legs are screaming at you to stop. That’s where real growth happens – in those final reps when you feel like you’ve got nothing left. If you want legs that stand out, you have to outwork everyone. Go deeper, push harder, and never back down from the challenge. That’s the Tom Platz mentality, and that’s how you build world-class legs.

                                        Now get out there and make it happen!</p>
